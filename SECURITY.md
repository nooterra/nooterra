# Security

Settld is a system-of-record product. We take security issues seriously.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately.

- Email: `aiden@settld.work`

Include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Reproduction steps / PoC where possible
- Affected versions / configs (if known)

## Disclosure policy

- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- We will coordinate a fix and a disclosure timeline with the reporter.
- We prefer a responsible disclosure window that allows patches to ship before public disclosure.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release line. For pilots, we strongly recommend pinning to an immutable image tag and enabling your image scanner in CI/CD.
