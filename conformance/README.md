# Conformance packs

Conformance packs are **language-agnostic test oracles** for Settld verification.

They are intended for:

- external verifier implementations (Go/Rust/etc.)
- auditors and partners who want “no guessing” reproducibility
- internal release gating (prevent protocol drift)

## Packs

- `conformance/v1/` — first conformance pack for protocol `v1` objects.
