# Before Nooterra vs After Nooterra (Demo Framing)

## Before Nooterra
- Telemetry exists, but it’s not finance-grade: logs can be disputed, reordered, or selectively omitted.
- Contracts/policy change over time, so “what rules applied?” becomes a debate.
- Credits and adjustments are manual and error-prone.
- “We sent the webhook” is not the same as “the customer received and verified it.”

## After Nooterra
- Facts are append-only and hash-chained; robot/operator signatures are verifiable.
- Jobs pin policy/contract hashes at the time the job is booked/matched.
- SLA breach detection and credits produce deterministic ledger effects.
- Outputs are immutable, verifiable artifacts (WorkCertificate, CreditMemo, SettlementStatement) delivered on idempotent rails.
