# Brand + Positioning Guidelines

## Product Naming

- Core runtime: **Nooterra Trust Kernel**
- Collaboration program: **Agent Collaboration Substrate**
- Network layer: **Nooterra Agent Network**

## External Messaging

Use this default one-liner in public copy:

> Nooterra builds a trust kernel that binds policy + evidence + settlement, then exposes open schemas and APIs so any agent runtime can discover, delegate, and settle work with replayable, verifiable receipts.

Use this short descriptor when space is tight:

> Trust kernel for the agent network.

## Naming Hygiene

- Do not use deprecated naming in public copy: `Settld`, `Codex`, `Nooverse`, `Agentverse`, `Nooterra Mesh`.
- Use **Agent Network** terminology for the cross-runtime layer.

## Version Language Policy

- Do not use `v1`/`v2` labels in product headlines, project names, or marketing copy.
- Keep explicit version identifiers in protocol/schema/API contract surfaces where compatibility depends on them:
  - `schemaVersion` fields
  - versioned spec filenames
  - conformance vector and migration artifacts

## GitHub + Linear Quality Bar

- Canonical repo/org references use `nooterra/nooterra`.
- Public docs and issue templates must not link to legacy org/repo paths.
- Project/epic names should be collaboration-first, not marketplace-only.
- Keep deterministic/fail-closed language explicit in summaries and acceptance criteria.
