# Circle Sandbox E2E (Reserve Adapter)

This guide is for validating the x402 reserve path against Circle sandbox before enabling production mode.

## Goal

Prove the reserve contract used by `POST /x402/gate/authorize-payment`:

1. Reserve succeeds before token mint.
2. Reserve failure does not mint a token.
3. Reserve rollback path restores internal wallet state.

## Required env

Set these for sandbox runs:

- `CIRCLE_E2E=1` (enables sandbox e2e tests)
- `CIRCLE_API_KEY` (sandbox key)
- `CIRCLE_BASE_URL=https://api-sandbox.circle.com`
- `CIRCLE_BLOCKCHAIN` (for example `BASE-SEPOLIA`)
- `CIRCLE_WALLET_ID_SPEND`
- `CIRCLE_WALLET_ID_ESCROW`
- `CIRCLE_TOKEN_ID_USDC`

If your environment uses a different naming convention, map these into the adapter config before running tests.

## Suggested test flow

1. Verify spend wallet has sufficient USDC.
2. Call reserve (`spend -> escrow`) with idempotency key = gate id.
3. Poll transaction status until terminal/safe state.
4. Attempt rollback:
   - cancel when still cancellable, or
   - compensating transfer (`escrow -> spend`) when already confirmed.
5. Verify resulting balances + persisted reserve status.

## Run command

After adapter wiring is complete:

```bash
CIRCLE_E2E=1 node --test test/circle-sandbox-reserve-e2e.test.js
```

## Pass criteria

- Reserve call returns a stable `reserveId`.
- Repeated reserve calls with same gate id are idempotent.
- Failed reserves return `X402_RESERVE_FAILED` and leave no stranded internal escrow lock.
- Rollback returns funds to spend wallet (cancel or compensation).
