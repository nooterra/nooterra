# FAQ

## Is Nooterra a payment network?

No. Nooterra is the enforcement and verification layer for economic outcomes. Payment rails are adapters.

## Do we need crypto?

No. Rail choice is independent from kernel enforcement semantics.

## What does “offline-verifiable” mean?

You can export closepacks and verify signatures/bindings/outcomes without querying Nooterra servers.

## What is Kernel v0 focused on?

Paid capability calls with holdbacks, disputes, deterministic adjustments, replay checks, and closepack verification.

## Is this open?

Protocol objects and conformance vectors are open; hosted operational/control-plane features are layered separately.
