# Production Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to launch and verify a real hosted Settld environment.

## Phase 0: Preflight

1. Confirm branch protection includes `tests / kernel_v0_ship_gate` and `tests / production_cutover_gate`.
2. Confirm release workflow is blocked unless both required gates are green for the release commit.
3. Confirm staging and production have separate domains, databases, secrets, and signer keys.
4. Confirm required services are deployable: `npm run start:prod`, `npm run start:maintenance`, `npm run start:x402-gateway`.

## Phase 1: Environment + secrets

1. Provision Postgres and store `DATABASE_URL`.
2. Set `STORE=pg`, `NODE_ENV=production`, `PROXY_MIGRATE_ON_STARTUP=1`.
3. Set scoped `PROXY_OPS_TOKENS`.
4. Configure rate limits and quotas from `docs/CONFIG.md`.
5. Configure gateway secrets: `SETTLD_API_URL`, `SETTLD_API_KEY`, `UPSTREAM_URL`.

## Phase 2: Deploy services

1. Deploy `settld-api`.
2. Deploy `settld-maintenance`.
3. Deploy `x402-gateway`.
4. Verify service health:

```bash
curl -fsS https://api.settld.work/healthz
curl -fsS https://gateway.settld.work/healthz
```

## Phase 3: Baseline ops verification

1. Run hosted baseline evidence command:

```bash
npm run ops:hosted-baseline:evidence -- \
  --base-url https://api.settld.work \
  --tenant-id tenant_default \
  --ops-token "$SETTLD_OPS_TOKEN" \
  --environment production \
  --out ./artifacts/ops/hosted-baseline-evidence-production.json
```

2. Confirm alert metric presence and health signals.
3. Run backup/restore drill evidence path at least once before opening customer traffic.

## Phase 4: MCP compatibility verification

1. Run core MCP automated tests:

```bash
node --test \
  test/mcp-stdio-spike.test.js \
  test/mcp-http-gateway.test.js \
  test/mcp-paid-exa-tool.test.js \
  test/mcp-paid-weather-tool.test.js \
  test/mcp-paid-llm-tool.test.js \
  test/demo-mcp-paid-exa.test.js
```

2. Run the hosted-style MCP smoke gate (API + magic-link bootstrap + MCP probe):

```bash
npm run test:ci:mcp-host-smoke
```

This emits a machine-readable report at:

`artifacts/ops/mcp-host-smoke.json`

3. Run host quickstart validation from `docs/QUICKSTART_MCP_HOSTS.md` for:
   Claude, Cursor, Codex, and OpenClaw.

4. Update `docs/ops/MCP_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md` with pass/fail + date.

## Phase 5: Paid call + receipt proof

1. Run a paid demo flow:

```bash
npm run demo:mcp-paid-exa
```

2. Confirm artifacts exist:
   `artifacts/mcp-paid-exa/.../summary.json` and gate/settlement evidence files in the same run directory.
3. Verify receipt path using existing verifier tooling.

## Phase 6: Go-live decision gate

Ship only when all are true:

1. Kernel v0 ship gate and production cutover gate are green.
2. Hosted baseline evidence is green.
3. MCP compatibility matrix is green for supported hosts.
4. Paid MCP run artifacts verify cleanly.
5. Rollback runbook has been rehearsed.

## Phase 7: Post-release

1. Monitor `/metrics` + SLO dashboards.
2. Track weekly reliability report (`docs/ops/X402_PILOT_WEEKLY_METRICS.md`).
3. Re-run compatibility checks on every major host release.
