# Pilot Kit (Verify Cloud / Magic Link)

This folder is the “send to prospects” kit for running a paid pilot:

- Buyer materials (what the page means, what to download, how to re-verify offline)
- Security posture summary (what we harden against)
- Integration starting point (webhooks)
- Simple ROI / billing templates

## Recommended pilot flow

1. Operator produces an `InvoiceBundle.v1` and uploads it to Verify Cloud (Magic Link).
2. Buyer receives the link, reviews Green/Amber/Red, and (optionally) records **Approve/Hold** on the page.
3. Buyer downloads the audit packet for archiving (bundle ZIP + deterministic JSON outputs).
4. Operator consumes the webhook event to drive their internal workflow.
