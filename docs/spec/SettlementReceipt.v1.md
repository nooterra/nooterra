# SettlementReceipt.v1

`SettlementReceipt.v1` is a signed receipt representing the final settlement outcome and transfer.

It binds the transfer to a specific decision record (and therefore to the agreement + evidence).

## receiptHash + signature

- `signature` is an Ed25519 signature over `receiptHash`.

The signer is expected to be the settlement service key.
