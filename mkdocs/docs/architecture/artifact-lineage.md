# Artifact Lineage

Primary artifacts:

- Quote envelope
- Authorization token
- Execution evidence
- Settlement receipt
- Reversal/adjustment events
- Closepack export bundle

Lineage guarantees:

- Every artifact references deterministic IDs and hashes.
- Receipts are snapshots; changes are append-only events.
- Offline closepacks include what auditors need to verify independently.
