# FAQ

## Is Settld only payments?
No. Payments are one primitive. The system spans identity, policy, execution, evidence, and operations.

## Can we verify without Settld online?
Yes. Closepacks are designed for offline verification.

## How do overrides work?
Policy blocks create signed escalation requests. Operators approve/deny via signed one-time decisions.

## What happens when agents become insolvent?
They are frozen, unwound, and archived through deterministic lifecycle controls.

## Is this production-ready?
Core primitives are production-directed. Use conformance and runbook gates before scaling to wider traffic.
