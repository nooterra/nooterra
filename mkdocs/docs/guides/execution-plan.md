# Trust OS Execution Plan (6 Weeks)

This plan maps strategy into a launch-ready execution sequence.

## End-State Targets

- TTFVR p50 <= 8 minutes
- onboarding completion >= 70% external cohort
- first paid-call+verification success >= 99.0%
- all P0 launch gates green for two consecutive weeks

## Weekly Sequence

1. Week 1: onboarding state machine + failure taxonomy lock
2. Week 2: auth/session/bootstrap reliability hardening
3. Week 3: managed wallet funding + first paid run golden path
4. Week 4: settlement/reversal idempotency + dispute hardening
5. Week 5: SRE/security/compliance launch gate prep
6. Week 6: controlled launch with command center

## Non-Negotiables

- no policy bypasses for paid actions,
- no launch with unresolved P0 security findings,
- deterministic receipts required for first-run success.
