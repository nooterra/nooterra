# Settld Documentation

Settld is the deterministic control plane for autonomous systems.

It gives agents bounded economic and operational autonomy through:

- Explicit identity and delegation lineage
- Policy-bounded authorization and execution gates
- Immutable receipts with append-only timelines
- Offline verification and reconciliation artifacts
- Human-in-the-loop escalation and lifecycle unwind controls

## What Is Live

- Delegated authorization + replay defense
- Escalation workflow with signed one-time overrides
- Webhook routing with signature verification + secret rotation
- Insolvency freeze, unwind hooks, and reversal dispatch
- ZK verification hooks and key registry support for verifiable labor
- Closepack export and offline verification

## Documentation Paths

- Start with [Quickstart](guides/quickstart.md)
- Learn architecture in [Control Plane](architecture/control-plane.md)
- Integrate with [API Surface](reference/api-surface.md)
- Operate safely with [Operations Runbook](runbooks/operations.md)
