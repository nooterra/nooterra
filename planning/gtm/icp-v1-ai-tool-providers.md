## ICP definition

- Company profile: 1-30 engineers, API-first, shipping paid tool endpoints quickly.
- Buyer personas: founder, platform lead, product engineer.
- User persona: backend engineer integrating contract, proof, settlement, dispute flows.

## Core pain

"We can execute calls, but we cannot prove completion and settle trust-minimized with customers."

## Trigger events

- Launching paid tool APIs
- Increasing refunds/disputes
- Enterprise buyer asks for verifiable receipts and governance controls

## Required outcomes

- Machine-verifiable completion receipts
- Conditional automatic settlement
- Policy caps and limits
- Deterministic dispute/arbitration workflow

## Positioning line

`Any autonomous task becomes a priced agreement with machine-verifiable completion and automatic settlement.`
