# S1 Target Accounts and Outreach Motion

Date baseline: February 7, 2026
Owner: GTM

## Vertical priorities

1. Agent-native SaaS teams with delegated automation workflows.
2. Operations/BPO teams with recurring SLA disputes and payout friction.

## ICP focus for self-serve

- Primary ICP: AI tool providers (1-30 engineers, API-first).
- Buyer: founder / platform lead / product engineer.
- User: backend engineer integrating proof/settlement/dispute.
- Pain statement: execution exists, but verifiable completion and trust-minimized settlement are missing.

## Account scoring model

Score each account 1-5 on:

- Pain severity (invoice/verification disputes).
- Transaction volume potential.
- Technical integration readiness.
- Budget authority access.

Prioritize accounts with total score >= 15.

## Top-of-funnel goals (S1)

- 20 target accounts mapped.
- 12 first meetings booked.
- 6 solution-fit evaluations.
- 3 paid pilot proposals.
- 2 pilot starts.

## Messaging pillars

- Deterministic proof, not screenshots.
- Faster settlement with fewer disputes.
- Trustless artifacts that survive vendor downtime.

## Weekly cadence

- Monday: outreach list refresh + account research.
- Tuesday-Thursday: outbound + demos.
- Friday: pipeline review and objection clustering.

## Conversion triggers

- Team reaches first verified run in live workflow.
- Finance/procurement accepts artifact and audit packet flow.
- Buyer confirms dispute cycle-time reduction potential.
