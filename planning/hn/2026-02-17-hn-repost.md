# HN Repost Draft (Tue 2026-02-17)

## Title

Show HN: x402 gateway that escrows 402 payments until verification PASS (provider-signed receipts)

## Body

Reposting with a narrower wedge. Nooterra is a thin x402-style proxy that converts `HTTP 402` into `hold -> verify -> release/refund` and emits a deterministic receipt trail.

- Default posture is strict: hold 100% up front, release 100% only on PASS; otherwise refund 100%.
- Verification correctness is explicit: the gateway computes a deterministic upstream response hash and passes it as evidence for the decision.
- If you configure a provider public key, the gateway requires an Ed25519 provider signature over the response hash (plus nonce/timestamp) before it will release funds.
- Receipts bind policy hash + reason codes + evidence refs so you can audit the decision later.

Quickstart:

```bash
npm ci && npm run quickstart:x402
```

If you tried and failed: run `./scripts/collect-debug.sh` and open an issue via the "Quickstart failure" template.
