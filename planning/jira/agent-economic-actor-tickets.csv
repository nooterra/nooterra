STLD-T2490,STLD-E2490,Implement passport issuance and lifecycle endpoint,Add API surface to issue rotate expire and revoke AgentPassport.v1 with auditable lifecycle events.,Backend + Security,4d,Highest,S1,,"passport,identity,lifecycle",Passport issuance endpoint validates schema and signer authority; revoke and expire states are enforced in privileged paid actions; audit trail is queryable.
STLD-T2491,STLD-E2490,Implement deterministic wallet assignment resolver,Resolve sponsorWalletRef policyRef and policyVersion from tenant environment profile risk tier and delegation depth.,Backend Platform,3d,Highest,S1,STLD-T2490,"wallet-assignment,policy-routing",Resolver returns deterministic mapping for identical inputs; resolver output is embedded into passport and settlement decision metadata; e2e tests cover dedicated and pooled wallet assignment.
STLD-T2492,STLD-E2490,Add funding policy and top-up automation,Introduce threshold-based funding policy for managed and BYO rails with reserve rollback guarantees.,Integrations + Backend,4d,High,S1,STLD-T2491,"funding,topup,reserve",Wallet funding thresholds are configurable per policy; top-up flow emits deterministic events; failed reserve and top-up paths roll back cleanly without double-settlement.
STLD-T2493,STLD-E2490,Bind execution intent to authorization and settlement,Require ExecutionIntent.v1 hash and request fingerprint to match authorize-payment and settlement verification paths.,Backend Platform,3d,Highest,S2,STLD-T2491,"execution-intent,binding,replay-protection",Authorize-payment rejects intent mismatch with stable codes; settlement verification rechecks intent binding; mutation and replay attempts fail in deterministic tests.
STLD-T2494,STLD-E2491,Implement autonomy tier policy packs,Ship Tier0 through Tier4 policy and profile packs with explicit spend risk delegation constraints and upgrade criteria.,Product + Protocol + CLI,3d,High,S2,STLD-T2493,"autonomy-tier,profiles,policy-packs",Tier policy packs are versioned and simulatable via CLI; each tier maps to concrete allowlists and spend limits; migration guidance is documented.
STLD-T2495,STLD-E2491,Add no-bypass and authority boundary gate suite,Create release-blocking negative tests for MCP stdio bridge HTTP and gateway paths plus signer and control authority boundary violations.,QA + Security,3d,Highest,S2,STLD-T2493,"no-bypass,authority,gates",Bypass attempts fail deterministically in CI; unauthorized signer and control actions fail with stable codes; suite is mandatory in release workflow.
STLD-T2496,STLD-E2491,Add onboarding and autonomy readiness SLO gates,Gate release on first-paid-call runtime SLO and policy decision latency and error SLO across host compatibility matrix.,DevEx + Observability + QA,2d,Highest,S2,STLD-T2495,"slo,onboarding,host-matrix",SLO thresholds are codified and enforced in CI; regressions fail release gates; reports include per-host readiness and failure reasons.
