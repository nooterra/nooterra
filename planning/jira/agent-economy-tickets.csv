"STLD-AE101","STLD-AE1","Add AgentPassport.v1 protocol object and schema","Formalize principal-backed agent identity envelope with delegation root, key anchors, and policy envelope hints.","Backend","S","Highest","","protocol,identity","Spec + schema merged; examples validate; object hash/signing rules documented with strict null/optional semantics."
"STLD-AE102","STLD-AE1","Implement delegation lineage resolver","Resolve effective authority from root->leaf grants with depth, expiry, and revocation checks.","Backend","L","Highest","STLD-AE101","delegation,authorization","Deterministic lineage resolution for same snapshot; explicit failure codes for revoked/expired/depth violations."

"STLD-AE201","STLD-AE2","Add ExecutionIntent.v1 protocol object and schema","Create canonical pre-execution intent with request fingerprint, risk profile, spend bounds, and policy binding.","Backend","S","Highest","STLD-AE102","protocol,intent,risk","Spec + schema merged; intent hash rules are deterministic and test vectors exist for canonicalization edge cases."
"STLD-AE202","STLD-AE2","Implement policy compiler and deterministic decision hash","Compile policy packs into executable constraints and emit deterministic decision fingerprints.","Backend","L","Highest","STLD-AE201","policy,determinism","Identical policy+intent input emits byte-equivalent decision records and stable evaluation hashes."
"STLD-AE203","STLD-AE2","Gate authorize-payment on issuer decision for all wallet-bound flows","Enforce issuer as sole mint authority and reject bypass paths.","Backend","M","Highest","STLD-AE202","security,issuer","All wallet-bound authorize paths fail without valid decision token; replay semantics remain idempotent."
"STLD-AE301","STLD-AE3","Define WorkContract.v1 protocol","Standardize obligations, milestones, settlement terms, and dispute venue for agent work contracts.","Backend + PM","M","High","STLD-AE203","contracts,protocol","Work contract schema supports milestone payment and dispute linkage without ambiguous state transitions."
"STLD-AE302","STLD-AE3","Implement contract milestone state machine","Add append-only milestone transitions with deterministic settle/reverse semantics.","Backend","L","High","STLD-AE301","state-machine,settlement","Milestone transitions are replay-safe; duplicate submissions do not double-settle."

"STLD-AE401","STLD-AE4","Implement marketplace resolver endpoint","Add policy-aware `resolve` API for tool/provider selection by intent, budget, and risk constraints.","Backend","L","High","STLD-AE203","resolver,marketplace","Resolver excludes uncertified/incompatible options by default and returns deterministic ranked results."
"STLD-AE402","STLD-AE4","Expose resolver as MCP tool","Allow agent runtimes to call Nooterra resolver directly through MCP surfaces.","DevEx + Backend","S","High","STLD-AE401","mcp,resolver","MCP tool returns machine-usable ranked options with trust bindings and policy compatibility flags."
"STLD-AE403","STLD-AE4","Implement negotiation thread protocol and API","Add offer/counter/accept/abort deterministic thread state machine.","Backend","L","Medium","STLD-AE401","negotiation,protocol","Thread replay reproduces final state exactly; invalid transitions return stable reject codes."
"STLD-AE501","STLD-AE5","Compute reputation deltas from verified outcomes only","Build reputation pipeline from receipt/outcome proofs; exclude unverifiable signals.","Backend + Data/Risk","L","High","STLD-AE302","reputation,trust","All reputation events contain source receipt ids; no mutation occurs without verifiable evidence chain."
"STLD-AE502","STLD-AE5","Implement credit decision service","Issue bounded credit lines based on policy + verified reliability metrics.","Backend + Risk","XL","Medium","STLD-AE501","credit,underwriting","Credit decisions are reproducible and include machine-readable rationale bindings to input evidence snapshots."
"STLD-AE503","STLD-AE5","Implement insurance claim evidence workflow","Add claim intake/decision path bound to outcome and contract evidence.","Backend","L","Medium","STLD-AE302","insurance,claims","Claim decisions are append-only, explainable, and bound to contract+receipt references."
"STLD-AE601","STLD-AE6","Define compliance decision protocol and policy packs","Add jurisdiction-aware compliance decision object and policy pack schema.","Backend + Security","L","High","STLD-AE202","compliance,protocol","Compliance decisions are deterministic, exportable, and include rule-level explainability fields."
"STLD-AE602","STLD-AE6","Implement oracle attestation adapter quorum","Add pluggable oracle adapter with quorum policy for real-world completion signals.","Backend + DevOps","L","Medium","STLD-AE302","oracle,attestation","Oracle disagreement follows deterministic quorum/fail-closed outcomes and is receipt-event traceable."
"STLD-AE603","STLD-AE6","Add physical rail adapters as certified tool contracts","Model payout/procurement/card flows as certified provider adapters instead of bespoke runtime paths.","Backend + DevEx","L","Medium","STLD-AE401,STLD-AE601","adapters,payout,procurement","Each adapter passes conformance and produces standard receipt/decision/reversal evidence with no privileged bypass channels."
