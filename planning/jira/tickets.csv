STLD-TA1,STLD-EA,Decide compositional settlement claim: wire or remove,"Hard cutoff: if cascade settlement cannot be wired into a real API path and proven with an integration test by Monday evening 2026-02-16, remove/soften the claim from HN post copy + README/Quickstart.",PM + Backend,0.5d,Highest,A,,"claim-integrity,hn,copy","By 2026-02-16 evening, exactly one of the following is true: (1) `cascadeSettlementCheck` is invoked by at least one end-to-end settlement/release API path and an integration test fails if it is not invoked, OR (2) all public-facing copy removes any claim that depends on a non-invoked cascade check."
STLD-TA2,STLD-EA,Wire cascadeSettlementCheck into a real API path with stable failure code,Option A (preferred): identify the first real settlement/release route users hit; insert `cascadeSettlementCheck` as pre-settlement validation and block or warn deterministically; surface a stable error/warning code when the cascade check fails.,Backend,2d,Highest,A,,"api,settlement,claim-integrity","There exists at least one end-to-end API route where calling settlement/release invokes `cascadeSettlementCheck`; an integration test fails if `cascadeSettlementCheck` is not invoked; a failing cascade check returns a deterministic response containing a stable, documented code; HN post copy references the feature consistent with the implementation (no implied behavior that does not exist)."
STLD-TA3,STLD-EA,Harden x402 gateway quickstart for Linux Docker networking,Fix the `host.docker.internal` footgun on Linux. Prefer using Docker networking/service names where possible; otherwise document a Linux-specific `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` / `--network host` path and how to override host connectivity via env vars.,DevEx,1d,Highest,A,,"quickstart,linux,docker,dx","`docs/QUICKSTART_X402_GATEWAY.md` contains (1) a single golden path with no inferred steps, (2) an objective copy-paste success check, (3) an explicit Linux path that does not rely on `host.docker.internal` luck, and (4) the quickstart can be run twice in a row without manual cleanup (or it prints a single explicit cleanup action)."
STLD-TA4,STLD-EA,Rewrite README into a single primary quickstart funnel,Make the top of `README.md` match HN-quality: problem -> what you get -> one runnable command -> expected receipt/success check -> one next-step link.,PM + DevEx,1d,Highest,A,,"readme,hn,activation",README top section has exactly one primary call-to-action path; the first screen contains a runnable command and an objective success check; all links in the first screen resolve to current docs and do not 404.
STLD-TA5,STLD-EA,Add quickstart feedback funnel and debug bundle,Make silence unambiguous by providing one canonical inbound and a fast way to submit a useful report. Add a Quickstart feedback issue template and a script to collect logs/versions into a single artifact.,PM + DevEx,1d,High,A,,"user-signal,issues,debug,dx","There is exactly one obvious ""I tried and failed"" link in the README and quickstart; a developer can file a useful quickstart report in <3 minutes using an issue template; and a `scripts/collect-debug.*` tool produces a single bundle containing docker/compose versions and relevant logs."
STLD-TA6,STLD-EA,Draft HN repost copy and lock publish time,Prepare the repost (title/body/links) and lock the publish window (target Tuesday 2026-02-17 8-9am ET). Ensure copy contains no claim that depends on unshipped or uninvoked code.,PM,0.5d,High,A,STLD-TA1,"hn,copy,links",A draft HN repost exists in-repo with final links; the intended publish time is written as an absolute timestamp with timezone; and the copy has passed a claim-integrity review against current code paths.
STLD-TA7,STLD-EA,Verify x402 gateway Docker image works from scratch,Confirm `ghcr.io/aidenlippert/settld/x402-gateway:latest` pulls and runs cleanly on a fresh machine and produces a receipt trail on first try.,DevOps + DevEx,0.5d,High,A,,"docker,image,quickstart",A documented command sequence exists where `docker pull` succeeds and the documented `docker run` flow completes a successful verify+release outcome without manual debugging.
STLD-TB1,STLD-EB,Implement install doctor command,"Add `settld doctor` (or `gateway doctor`) that prints docker/compose versions, ports in use, inter-service connectivity checks, and a single pass/fail with one next action.",DevEx,2d,Highest,B,,"dx,doctor,install","A `doctor` command exists, runs locally, and outputs copy-pasteable diagnostics including: docker version, compose version, required ports availability, and pass/fail checks with explicit remediation steps."
STLD-TB2,STLD-EB,Harden top 5 install failures with explicit remediation,"From Sprint A triage, identify the 5 most common install/quickstart failures and make each self-diagnosing via error messages and/or docs one-liners.",Backend + DevEx,2d,High,B,STLD-TA5,"errors,docs,dx","The top 5 install failures from Sprint A have explicit remediation documented, and error messages include what happened, why, and the single next action."
STLD-TB3,STLD-EB,Ship one no-edit reference integration,Pick exactly one integration that matches the HN audience (tool provider selling an API). It must run end-to-end and produce a receipt without editing code.,DevEx,3d,High,B,,"integration,example,activation",A reference integration exists where a user can run it end-to-end without editing code and it produces a receipt demonstrating: work -> proof bundle -> verify -> receipt.
STLD-TB4,STLD-EB,Track daily activation metrics,"Track only three numbers daily: install attempts, first receipt count, first settlement (or first paid event) count.",PM,0.5d,High,B,STLD-TA5,"metrics,activation,triage","Each morning you can answer: how many tried, how many succeeded (first receipt), and where they dropped off, using a single daily log artifact."
STLD-TB5,STLD-EB,Maintain 7-day support SLA,Operational commitment: every inbound gets a first response within 12 hours for the first 7 days post-HN; every install-failed report gets a fix or workaround within 48 hours.,PM,0.2d,High,B,STLD-TA5,"support,sla,ops","For the 7 days following 2026-02-17, a dated log shows (1) first response time <= 12 hours for all inbounds and (2) install-failed reports receive a fix or documented workaround within 48 hours."
STLD-TC1,STLD-EC,Select and ship the single biggest real blocker,Selection rule: choose the most common request that blocks real usage; it must reduce integration time or increase trust in receipts; it must be shippable end-to-end in <=10 days.,PM + Backend,5d,High,C,STLD-TB4,"signal-driven,scope,activation","One blocker is explicitly selected from post-HN triage, shipped end-to-end, and the change reduces measured time-to-first-receipt (even on a small sample). Docs and demo are updated to reflect the new path."
STLD-TC2,STLD-EC,Clarify pricing and packaging in 30 seconds,Do not rebuild pricing. Make it legible: what triggers billing and what the first paid tier buys.,PM,1d,High,C,,"pricing,packaging,docs","A new developer can understand what triggers billing in <=30 seconds of reading, and the first paid tier maps to a clear value boundary (volume/compliance/audit export/dispute tooling)."
STLD-TD1,STLD-ED,Harden reliability based on observed load and failure modes,"Prioritize data safety and operability: address any data-loss classes from triage, add backpressure/rate limits where needed, and prove basic runbooks with a kill-and-recover exercise.",Backend + DevOps,5d,High,D,,"reliability,runbooks,hardening",No known data-loss class from triage remains unaddressed; backpressure/rate limiting exists where required; and a documented kill-and-recover drill has been run successfully with notes and runbook updates.
