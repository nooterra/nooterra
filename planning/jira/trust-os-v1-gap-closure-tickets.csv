STLD-T2480,STLD-E2480,Publish canonical Trust OS v1 contract document,Freeze a single v1 contract document defining hard guarantees explicit non-goals fail-closed semantics and deterministic evidence requirements.,PM + Architecture,2d,Highest,S1,,"contract,scope,governance",Contract doc is published in docs with in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries; fail-closed guarantees are explicit; release checklist references the contract as a required artifact.
STLD-T2481,STLD-E2480,Add numeric SLO thresholds for Trust OS runtime and onboarding,Define and enforce numeric thresholds for policy latency deterministic hash stability dispute SLA timing and time-to-first-verified-receipt.,Platform + DevEx,3d,Highest,S1,STLD-T2480,"slo,observability,onboarding",SLO thresholds are documented and measured; CI gates fail when threshold checks regress; weekly reports include baseline and delta per SLO.
STLD-T2482,STLD-E2480,Enforce authority boundary contract for signer and emergency controls,Codify who can sign policy who can rotate or revoke keys and who can trigger pause quarantine kill controls with rollback requirements.,Security + Backend,3d,Highest,S1,STLD-T2480,"authority,signing,emergency-controls",Authority model is documented and tested; unauthorized signer or control actions fail with stable codes; rollback path is verified in automated test flow.
STLD-T2483,STLD-E2480,Require adapter invariant conformance for new rail lanes,Block adapter promotion unless shared trust-kernel invariants pass for policy enforcement replay protection receipt determinism and reversal idempotency.,Integrations + QA,3d,High,S2,STLD-T2481,"adapters,conformance,invariants",Adapter conformance suite runs in CI for each lane; merge and release fail on invariant regression; report artifact includes invariant IDs and failed surfaces.
STLD-T2484,STLD-E2480,Add no-bypass negative matrix for MCP and bridge paths,Add explicit deny or challenge bypass attempts across stdio MCP HTTP MCP bridge and paid tool bridges to prove policy runtime cannot be skipped.,MCP + QA,2d,Highest,S1,STLD-T2480,"mcp,no-bypass,security",Negative matrix test suite covers stdio and HTTP paths; all bypass attempts fail deterministically with stable reason codes; suite is included in required release gates.
STLD-T2485,STLD-E2480,Add deterministic repeat-run export soak check,Stress deterministic export paths with repeated runs and assert stable canonical hashes for equivalent inputs.,Protocol + QA,2d,High,S2,STLD-T2481,"determinism,receipts,soak",Repeated export runs for fixed fixtures produce identical canonical hashes; drift is surfaced with artifact diffs; soak check is release-blocking.
