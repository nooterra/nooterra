## ICP definition

- Segment: AI tool providers (1-30 engineers, API-first, rapid ship cadence)
- Buyers: founder, product engineer, platform lead
- Primary users: backend and platform engineers integrating proof/settlement/dispute APIs
- Trigger events: paid endpoint launch, dispute/refund growth, enterprise onboarding requiring verifiable receipts
- Must-win outcomes: machine-verifiable receipts, automatic settlement, policy caps, dispute workflow

## Positioning

Nooterra for AI Tool Providers:

`Turn any tool invocation into a verified economic transaction: contract, proof, settlement, dispute.`

## Pricing (self-serve usage-led)

1. Free
- Sandbox only + capped live trial
- No real payout rails

2. Builder ($99/mo)
- 10k verified runs/month included
- 0.75% settled volume fee
- Basic dispute workflows
- 30-day evidence retention

3. Growth ($599/mo)
- 100k verified runs/month included
- 0.45% settled volume fee
- Arbitration queue + policy packs
- 180-day retention + exports

4. Enterprise (custom annual)
- volume tiers
- 0.20%-0.35% settled volume fee
- custom compliance/support terms

Overages:

- arbitration cases: $2/case (Builder), $1/case (Growth)

## North-star and funnel

- North-star: `MVSV` (Monthly Verified Settled Value)
- Secondary: verified settlements count, take-rate revenue, dispute rate, time-to-first-settlement

Funnel:
1. signup
2. tenant + API key created
3. first instrumented endpoint
4. first verified run
5. first live settlement
