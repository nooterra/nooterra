# Trust OS v1 Sprint 01 Plan (Weeks 1-2)

Window: 2026-02-23 to 2026-03-06
Project: Trust OS v1 (Linear)

## Sprint objective

Ship the first enforceability slice of Trust OS v1:

1. Policy decision artifacts + high-risk route enforcement.
2. Execution intent binding + replay/mutation denial.
3. No-bypass host bridge regression checks.
4. Signed operator action foundation and emergency control path.
5. First release evidence packet path in CI.

## Suggested assignees

- `aidenlippert` (Tech Lead + Backend + QA/DevOps): policy runtime, execution binding, operator/emergency APIs, bypass regression, offline verify parity, baseline evidence gate.

## Committed tickets (Sprint 01)

1. `NOO-43` Define and implement `PolicyDecision.v1` schema + signing.
2. `NOO-45` Normalize reason codes and policy fingerprinting across runtimes.
3. `NOO-44` Enforce trust-kernel middleware on all high-risk routes.
4. `NOO-47` Enforce `ExecutionIntent` request fingerprint binding across authorize+execute.
5. `NOO-48` Implement replay/mutation deterministic denial paths.
6. `NOO-46` Add MCP/host bridge bypass regression suite.
7. `NOO-50` Add offline verification parity gate for receipt bundles.
8. `NOO-55` Define `OperatorAction.v1` schema and signature verification.
9. `NOO-57` Implement emergency control APIs (pause/quarantine/revoke/kill-switch).
10. `NOO-62` Publish hosted baseline evidence packet per release candidate.

## Stretch tickets (if committed work completes early)

1. `NOO-51` Implement dispute case lifecycle state machine + invariants.
2. `NOO-52` Map arbitration verdicts to idempotent release/refund/reversal outcomes.
3. `NOO-64` Automate launch cutover packet generation and signing.
4. `NOO-65` Enforce release promotion guard on gate pass/fail status.

## Sequencing and dependencies

1. `NOO-43` -> `NOO-45` -> `NOO-44` -> `NOO-46`.
2. `NOO-44` -> `NOO-47` -> `NOO-48` -> `NOO-50`.
3. `NOO-55` -> `NOO-57`.
4. `NOO-50` -> `NOO-62` -> `NOO-64` -> `NOO-65`.

## Week 1 plan (2026-02-23 to 2026-02-27)

1. Start `NOO-43`, `NOO-45`, and `NOO-55` in parallel.
2. Move `NOO-44` into active build once `NOO-43` and `NOO-45` contracts are stable.
3. Start `NOO-47` contract wiring when `NOO-44` route inventory is complete.
4. Start `NOO-46` test harness skeleton and host matrix setup.
5. Week 1 exit: merged schema contracts + route middleware skeleton + signed operator artifact path.

## Week 2 plan (2026-03-02 to 2026-03-06)

1. Complete `NOO-48` replay/mutation denial logic and error stability checks.
2. Finish and enforce `NOO-46` bypass regression suite in CI.
3. Complete `NOO-50` offline verification parity gate.
4. Complete `NOO-57` emergency control APIs and audit events.
5. Complete `NOO-62` baseline evidence packet generation and release linkage.
6. Pull in stretch work starting with `NOO-51` if all committed gates are green.

## Definition of done for Sprint 01

1. All committed tickets reach Done with passing CI.
2. Bypass regression and replay/mutation suites are green.
3. Offline verify parity gate is enabled and blocking on failure.
4. Baseline evidence packet is generated for release candidates.
5. Sprint review includes evidence links per committed ticket.

## Daily execution rhythm

1. Daily 15-minute standup with blocker review on critical-path dependencies.
2. Midday CI review for gate drift, determinism, and flaky test detection.
3. End-of-day status update in Linear with next dependency unlock.

## Risk watchlist

1. Policy code normalization drift across API/worker boundaries (`NOO-45`).
2. Hidden integration bypass routes not covered by initial host matrix (`NOO-46`).
3. Determinism drift in verification parity when fixture updates land (`NOO-50`).
4. Emergency control semantics mismatch across service boundaries (`NOO-57`).
