# Phase 1 Closure Wave 2 (2026-02-22)

Branch: `codex/phase1-snapshot-2026-02-22`

## Scope completed in this wave

- Enforced emergency-control RBAC role matrix and dual-control for sensitive actions (`revoke`, `kill-switch`, and sensitive `resume` paths).
- Added explicit dual-approval event evidence (`secondOperatorAction`) and response metadata.
- Added OpenAPI coverage for `/ops/emergency/revoke` and dual-control request/response fields.
- Added documentation for operator-action emergency policy constraints.

## Ticket evidence mapping

- `NOO-53` (appeal linkage/lineage checks): validated by arbitration workspace and appeal flow tests.
- `NOO-56` (operator inbox APIs): validated by arbitration queue/workspace API tests.
- `NOO-58` (RBAC + dual-control): implemented and validated in this wave.
- `NOO-59` (adapter conformance): validated by adapter + Circle reserve conformance tests.
- `NOO-60` (adapter idempotency/retry): validated by idempotency/dispute settlement tests.
- `NOO-61` (kernel↔adapter trust boundary): validated by tamper-blocking settlement binding tests.
- `NOO-63` (throughput + incident fail-closed gate): validated by throughput, production cutover, and release promotion gate tests.
